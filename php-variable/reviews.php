                  It was very nice hotel with cleanliness. Staff behavior was
                  good and polite. They welcome us very well. Issue was only
                  that Lift was not in working and we were allotted to 3rd floor
                  and amenities articles were in corner of gallery which were
                  giving bad feeling. Breakfast was good and support of the
                  staff was also very nice. Location is not good as per
                  atmosphere, it is very nearby most o the popular places but
                  self location in a narrow street is not good. Overall it was a
                  good experience and could recommend.
